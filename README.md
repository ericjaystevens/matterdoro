## Vision

Improve focus, work intentional, and do what matters most.

Matterdoro can perform essential work and break time management. It should also be able to change status and integrate with other communication tools to limit distractions during working intervals. 

It should allow you to identify what you are working on (plan your day) and show reports on amounts of focused work.

It should encourage you to break problems into small actionable pieces and gamify the number of Pomodoros completed in a day/week/month.
